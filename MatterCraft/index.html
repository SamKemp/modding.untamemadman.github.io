<p>A mod all about Matter.</p>
<br>
<p> Mod includes: <br> 
DARK MATTER APPEARANCE:
<br>
All Dark Matter items are black with at least one red spot on them.
 <br>
<br>
DARK MATTER ORE:
<br>
This can be found in the Nether and the End. It is very rare in the Nether, but is more common in the End. You need a diamond pickaxe to mine it, and
can be found in groups of up to 5. For each ore block, you get one Dark Matter Resin. You need to smelt the resin to make a dark matter ingot.
<br>
<br>
DARK MATTER TOOLS & ARMOUR:
<br>
These can be made just like any other tool or armour. They are the strongest armour and tools in the game (tied with Light Matter) and the pickaxes
can mine through anything almost instantaniously. Even Bedrock. Having a full set of armour allows you to survive in lava and not drown in water. You
also don't take fall damage.
<br>
<br>
DARK MATTER BLOCK, STAIR, & SLAB:
<br>
These are made with the same arrangement of any other block like this, but must be made with Dark Matter Ingots, not Dark Matter Resin. Like the ore,
they can only be mined using a diamond pickaxe. They are also invisible at night.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
LIGHT MATTER APPEARANCE:
<br>
All Light Matter items are white with at least one blue spot on them.
<br>
<br>
LIGHT MATTER ORE:
<br>
This can be found in the Overworld Stronghold in ores, or as ingots in chests. Like Dark Matter Ore, you need a diamond pickaxe to mine it, but can
only be found in groups of 2-3. For each block, you get 1 or 2 Light Matter Resin, which must be smelted to make an ingot.
<br>
<br>
LIGHT MATTER TOOLS AND ARMOUR:
<br>
These can be made just like any other tool or armour. They are the strongest armour and tools in the game (tied with Dark Matter) and the pickaxes
can "copy and paste" blocks by right-clicking the mouse. Having a full set of armour allows you to fly for a 30 second period, with a 10 second recharge,
and take no fall damage.
<br>
<br>
LIGHT MATTER BLOCK, STAIR, AND SLAB:
<br>
These are made with the same arrangement of any other block like this, but must be made with Light Matter Ingots, not Light Matter Resin. Like the ore,
they can only be mined using a diamond pickaxe. They are also invisible during the day.
